### Github Project Badges

Github has a number of badges that you can add to your README.

Here are some of the most popular:

#### Build Status

You can add a badge to your README that shows the status of your build. This is a great way to show the status of your CI/CD pipeline.

Build: when you push to your repository, your CI/CD pipeline will run. If the build is successful, the badge will show a green checkmark. If the build fails, the badge will show a red X.

#### Code Coverage

You can add a badge to your README that shows the code coverage of your tests. This is a great way to show the quality of your tests.

Code Coverage: when you push to your repository, your CI/CD pipeline will run your tests. If the code coverage is above a certain threshold, the badge will show a green checkmark. If the code coverage is below a certain threshold, the badge will show a red X.

## GIFs

GIFs are a great way to add some life to your README. 

If you want to use an existing GIF, you can find some great options:

<details>
<summary>GIF Resources (click to expand)</summary>

- [Giphy](https://giphy.com/)
- [Gfycat](https://gfycat.com/)
- [Imgur](https://imgur.com/)
- [Tenor](https://tenor.com/)

</details>

Alternatively, you may want to record your own GIF. Here are some great tools for recording GIFs:

<details>
<summary>GIF Recording Tools (click to expand)</summary>

- [Giphy Capture](https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture)
- [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/)
- [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/)
- [Gifox](https://gifox.io/) *Paid, but very good*

</details>

### GIF Compression
Github allows you to embed GIFs in your README, **but** the maximum size is 10MB. If your GIF is larger than 10MB, you can use a tool like [XConvert](https://gfycat.com/) to compress it. You can also compress a GIF locally using [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).

### Embedding GIFs

To embed a GIF in your README, simply drag and drop the GIF into the README in edit mode. Github will automatically upload the GIF and embed it in the README.

![gif_demo](https://github.com/jacobmarks/ultimate-project-readme/assets/12500356/e36b1273-460a-4852-946f-ac46f79f2cf7)

**Note:** You technically *can* use the markdown syntax to embed a GIF, but then the file will add to the size of your repository. If you drag and drop the GIF, it will be uploaded to Github's servers and will not add to the size of your repository.

### Encoding GIFs as Images

when you embed a GIF with the `.gif` extension in your README, you will need to press play to see the animation. If you want the GIF to animate automatically, you can encode it as an image with the `.png` extension. To do this, simply change the extension of the GIF from `.gif` to `.png`. This will cause the GIF to animate automatically!

Here's an example from the amazing [Tuana √áelik](https://github.com/TuanaCelik)!

![gif_demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15802862/220481971-ce7feeef-d5a3-4916-b8c3-feaf094e489f.png)

## Links

### Basic Links

You can add links to your README using the markdown syntax:

```md
[Link Text](https://www.example.com)
```

üëâ [Link Text](https://www.example.com)

Alternatively, you can use HTML:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Link Text</a>
```

üëâ <a href="https://www.example.com">Link Text</a>

### Relative Links

You can also add relative links to your README using the syntax:

```md
[Relative Link Text](./path/to/file)
```

For instance, if you want to link to the [data.csv](./automation/data.csv) file in your repository containing papers, you can use the syntax:

```md
[data.csv](./automation/data.csv)
```

### Anchor Links

You can add anchor links to your README using the syntax:

```md
[Anchor Link Text](#anchor-name)
```

For instance, if you want to link to the [Usage](#usage) section of your README, you can use the syntax:

```md
[Usage](#usage)
```

**Note:** If your section header has emojis or special characters, you will need to **remove them** from the anchor link. For instance, if you want to link to the [Installation](#-installation) section of your README, you can would use the syntax:

```md
[Installation](#-installation)
```


### Direct Links to Issues and Pull Requests

You can add direct links to issues and pull requests using the syntax:

```md
[Issue #num](https://github.com/user/repo/issues/num)
```

To link to [issue #1](https://github.com/jacobmarks/ultimate-project-readme/issues/1) in this repository, you can use the syntax:

```md
[Issue #1](https://github.com/jacobmarks/ultimate-project-readme/issues/1)
```

## Code Blocks

You can add code blocks to your README using the markdown syntax:

<pre>
```
print("Hello World!")
```
</pre>

üëá

```
print("Hello World!")
```

### Syntax Highlighting

You can also add syntax highlighting to your code blocks by specifying the language:

#### Python

<pre>
```python
print("Hello World!")
```
</pre>

üëá

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

#### JavaScript

<pre>
```javascript
console.log("Hello World!")
```
</pre>

üëá

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!")
```

### Tables

#### Basic Tables

You can add tables to your README using the markdown syntax:

```md
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Row 1    | Row 1    | Row 1    |
| Row 2    | Row 2    | Row 2    |
| Row 3    | Row 3    | Row 3    |
```

üëá

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Row 1    | Row 1    | Row 1    |
| Row 2    | Row 2    | Row 2    |
| Row 3    | Row 3    | Row 3    |


You can use tools like [Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to generate these tables.

You can also use HTML to create tables:

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Column 1</th>
    <th>Column 2</th>
    <th>Column 3</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 1</td>
    <td>Row 1</td>
    <td>Row 1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 2</td>
    <td>Row 2</td>
    <td>Row 2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 3</td>
    <td>Row 3</td>
    <td>Row 3</td>
  </tr>

</table>

```

üëá

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Column 1</th>
    <th>Column 2</th>
    <th>Column 3</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 1</td>
    <td>Row 1</td>
    <td>Row 1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 2</td>
    <td>Row 2</td>
    <td>Row 2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 3</td>
    <td>Row 3</td>
    <td>Row 3</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Multi-Line Cells

You can add multi-line cells to your tables using the syntax:

```md
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Line 1<br>Line 2 | Text |
```

üëá

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Line 1<br>Line 2 | Text |

#### Alignment

You can align the text in your tables using the syntax:

```md

| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| text         |    text        |          text |


```

üëá

| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| text         |    text        |          text |


#### Automating Table Generation

Sometimes, you may have data that is changing frequently, and you want to display it in a table in your README. For instance, you may have a table of the latest version numbers of your project's dependencies. In this case, you may want to automate the generation of the table from a CSV file.
